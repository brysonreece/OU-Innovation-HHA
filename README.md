####Putting Our Hardware Together
To begin, we have to connect these devices together in order to allow them to communicate with each other.

######Amazon Echo
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Begin by setting up your Amazon Echo using [Amazon's instructions](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201601770).
  
#####Raspberry Pi
 * First begin by downloading [Raspbian Jessie](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) and [installing to your SD card](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/).
